# java-final_project

This is my final project submission for ITMD 411. In this project, I make a ticket help desk system utilizing JavaFX and SQL commands in Java to add tickets and manage them from both user and admin side. Users can create tickets and view them, but not much else. Admins on the other hand have all functions enabled with an extra "show tickets" option to display everyone's tickets.
